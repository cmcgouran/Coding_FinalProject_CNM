Coding Final Project\
\
This projects goal was to create a code which runs a BLASTn search on sequence queries and\
return an output file containing the BLAST results. This was accomplished using the Biopython\
package and associated modules.\
\
\
Prerequisites\
\
This program requires Python 3 or higher to run.\
Biopython is also required and was imported using the command \'93import Bio\'94. Additionally, the Biopython modules NCBIWWW and NCBIXML. Both were imported using Bio.Blast. NCBIWWW was used to access the BLAST database online and NCBIXML was used to parse through the output results file.\
